# Supplementary Files

In here are just some files that I personally use to assist in writing and testing searchlight. They're kind of hidden away in /test_data cause I don't want this directory cluttering up the top-level directory any more than it is, although really this does belong there.

.hexpat files are [ImHex](https://imhex.werwolv.net/) pattern language files.
